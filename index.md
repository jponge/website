I am a **Senior Principal Software Engineer** (_individual contributor_) at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/).
I am based in [Lyon, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon).

I am primarily working on _reactive_ things, including [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io/), [Mutiny](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/) and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io).

I am the author of the reference book [Vert.x in Action - Reactive Java](https://www.manning.com/books/vertx-in-action) published by Manning.

Before joining Red Hat, I was an **Associate Professor** in computer science and engineering at [INSA Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/) and the [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) where I have held various teaching, research, management and executive positions.

My long-standing contributions to the Java community got me elected as a [Java Champion](https://javachampions.org/).
