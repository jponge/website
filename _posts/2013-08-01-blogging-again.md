Blogging has had a hard time with the rise of social media where the *shorter* is the *better*.

Like many friends, I gradually reduced my blogging activities up to the point of stopping it. There
is no trace of my past blogs, except maybe if you look into the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php).

I found what I had expected to be a solution in the previous instalment of my website in the form of
*notes* that were supposed to be random longer-form writings. This was great, but in the end of the
day this was just a blog in disguise.

After a long pause, I now feel the need for *blogging again*.

While I won't blog every week, I feel that there is a missing bit in the way that I communicate.
A missing bit that neither the walled gardens of Twitter, Tumblr or Google+ can replace: taking the
time to craft a post that will end on my personal website instead of being trapped in the constant
massive flow of information that feed the so-called *"social profiles"*.

This new blog has an import of a very limited set of past entries that I found worth keeping. I have
a good backlog of items to blog about, but I will take time to do so.

*Spoiler alert:* expect a series of posts on the `invokedynamic`-based runtime internals of
[Golo](http://golo=lang.org/) explained in an accessible manner.

Until next time, I suggest that you:

- [subscribe to my feed](/feed.xml), and
- [follow me on Twitter (@jponge)](https://twitter.com/jponge).
