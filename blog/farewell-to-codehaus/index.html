    <p>I would like to take a moment to thank Ben Walding and Bob McWhirter who were
behind <a href="http://codehaus.org/">the Codehaus</a>, one of the most prominent
opensource Java project community and hosting platform ever.</p>

<p>The writing was probably on the wall for some time, and today they announced the end of Codehaus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The time has come to end the era of Codehaus.</p>

  <p>With increasing diversity in opensource hosting platforms like Github and Bitbucket - who are meeting the needs of 1000s of projects - it makes sense to end the opensource hosting services of Codehaus.</p>

  <p>Codehaus has operated at a loss for several years now (we’re not powered by venture capital), and can not compete with the army of developers and integrated product offerings that are now commonplace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Codehaus was selective on projects: you would not get your project here just
like you would open a SourceForge project in a few click. Codehaus was a space
made by and for hackers, with fewer constraints than Apache-style foundations.</p>

<p>Codehaus was the place to find Groovy, the widely-used Mojo Maven plugins,
XStream, Jackson, Castor, PicoContainer, early versions of Drools, EasyMock,
early versions of Gradle, Grails, Griffon, pre-Eclipse Jetty, Jettison, StAX,
XDoclet and many more.</p>

<p>I remember how proud I was when I managed to move <a href="http://izpack.org/">IzPack</a>
there. IzPack gained serious traction by joining Codehaus, and the project
hosting infrastructure was top notch.</p>

<p>I can’t help but look back and realize how much the Java landscape has changed
since Codehaus was at its peak. The vast majority of the Codehaus projects are
now either dead or simply very rooted in the past, forming legacies from
a significant era of the Java history.</p>

<p>That being said the closing of Codehaus is not to be perceived as a sign of the
so often predicted <em>end of Java</em>. Tools and practices evolve, and the Java
ecosystem is never short of new blood influx. The future of the JVM as
a foundation for increasingly simpler and efficient programming models is
bright.</p>

<p>Again: thanks Ben, thanks Bob, Codehaus <em>“was a thing”</em>.</p>
