After:

* an academic sabbatical, and
* a career bet, and
* a job change, and
* a minor health issue and my ever first surgery, and
* a pandemic that greatly disrupts lives across the world...

I am happy to announce that my book **[Vert.x in Action (Asynchronous and Reactive Java)](https://www.manning.com/books/vertx-in-action?a_aid=vertx-in-action&a_bid=22152024)** has been published! 🥳

I have so many people to thank that the best is to read the _acknowledgements_ section of the book 😇

Writing this book has been a long and fun journey.
I wrote this book with the goal of teaching concepts that will still be relevant in the years to come, and I hope that you will learn useful lessons from it!

Have fun and take care 👍
