Two years ago I ventured into spending some time in industry.
I was _delegated_ by INSA Lyon to work with Red Hat on the Eclipse Vert.x project.

What had to happen happened: I loved the experience, enjoyed working with the people here, started interesting work, and after 2 years it became just too soon to end the journey.

I always wanted to work at the frontier between industry and academia, and Red Hat gave me the chance and the perfect context to do it.

I am glad to start today as a _Principal Software Engineer_ at Red Hat, and I look forward to the fun challenges ahead!
The _reactive_ space is an interesting place to be.
More generally, modern distributed systems are all the rage, and we are no short of challenges to help teams better deliver _highly-scalable_ and _resilient_ systems.

On a side-note: I am *not* leaving academia.

I will be _on leave_ from INSA Lyon, but I will remain involved with research at the CITI Laboratory and keep collaborating with my team.
At the very least I will keep supervising Jean-Baptiste (_disciple #2_) and Patrik (_disciple #3_) as they work towards getting their PhDs.

I learned and grew up a lot over the past 9 years at INSA.
It has not always been an easy ride, but it was worth every bit of it.
I am thankful to the people I worked with here, and I am also very grateful to the institution that gave me every support to follow this path.

Hello, Red Hat!
